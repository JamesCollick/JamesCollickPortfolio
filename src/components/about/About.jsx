                  I'm a proud graduate of Herzing University, having earned my Bachelor of Science degree, magna cum laude, with a 3.8 GPA. For the past four years, I've worked as a freelance UI/UX designer, blending aesthetics with usability to create meaningful digital experiences.

My journey into interface design and development began in the early days of MySpace, where I first discovered the thrill of customizing layouts, editing code, and exploring the power of digital self-expression. That formative experience sparked a lifelong fascination with user interfaces and marked the moment I became a student of the digital art world.

Today, I bring that same curiosity, creativity, and precision to every project I take on. Whether I'm wireframing a new app, designing a seamless user flow, or coding responsive interfaces, I'm driven by the idea that great design isn't just about how something looks â€” it's about how it feels to use.

With an eye toward innovation and a deep respect for intuitive design, I'm eager to contribute to forward-thinking teams and help shape technology that's as beautiful as it is functional.
